# Quick Start Guide

1. for administrator of cluster :
    - If you want to except some images or namespaces from validation, add it to white list config map named `image-validation-webhook-whitelist` in `registry-system` namespace.
    - In the configmap, there're two json data: `whitelist-images`, `whitelist-namespaces`. Add an image's name to `whitelist-images` or a namespace's name to `whitelist-namespaces`. (Refer to the [example](./deploy/whitelist-configmap.yaml))  
      `CAUTION`: Multiple whitelist entries must be separated by a newline(\n)
    - For `whitelist-images`, wildcard for image name is supported.  
      e.g., if `whitelist-image` contains `registry-example.com/*`, then `registry-example.com/image-1` `registry-example.com/image-2` are treated as whitelisted.
    - For `whitelist-images`, host, tag, digest can be omitted. They will be treated as a wildcard.  
      e.g., `registry` in `whitelist-images` will treat `registry-1.com/registry:tag1` and `registry-2.com/registry:tag2` as whitelisted.

2. for user :

    - Default policy of image-validation-webhook is permitting pod creation with images from any registries.
    - You can restrict which registries to pull the images from: Use CRD named RegistySecurityPolicy & ClusterRegistrySecurityPolicy: Sample is
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: tmax.io/v1
      kind: RegistrySecurityPolicy
      metadata:
        name: sample-policy
        namespace: some-namespace
      spec:
        registries:
          - registry: core.harbor.domain.io
            notary: https://notary.harbor.domain.io
            signCheck: true
      ---
      apiVersion: tmax.io/v1
      kind: ClusterRegistrySecurityPolicy
      metadata:
        name: sample-cluster-policy
      spec:
        registries:
          - registry: docker.io
            signCheck: true
      ```
    - RegistrySecurityPolicy is a namespaced scope resource and you can add the trusted registries to `registries` list
    - ClusterRegistrySecurityPolicy is a cluster scope resource and works exactly same as RegistrySecurityPolicy in all namespaces
    - registries array consists of

        - Registry: Registry's url
        - Notary: Registry's corresponding notary server url
        - Signcheck: If it is false, all images from this registry are allowed without checking their signature

    - Example flows of image validity check
        1. Image is whitelisted : VALID
        2. No Policy : VALID
        3. Policies exists & image registry source is not contained in the policies : INVALID
        4. Policies exists & image registry source is allow by the policies & signcheck is false : VALID
        5. Policies exists & image registry source is allow by the policies & signcheck is true -> check sign
            - Image is signed : VALID
            - Image is not signed : INVALID
